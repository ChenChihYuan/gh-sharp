Good evening, everyone,

I have attached a Grasshopper template for how we discussed laying out our files. For this example file I have used the tab Vector and the sub-tab Plane shown in the image below.

In the Grasshopper file the components are oriented in a similar fashion to how they are displayed in the tabs with the original grasshopper component on top and the C# equivalent below. I included a number of notes in the panel at left regarding colors and other necessary information but I could be missing something. Please feel free to reach out if you have any comments, concerns, or questions about formatting.
